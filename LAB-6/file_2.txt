It also has some important applications in data science. In this article, I will try to explain the mathematical intuition behind SVD and its geometrical meaning. Instead of manual calculations, I will use the Python libraries to do the calculations and later give you some examples of using SVD in data science applications. Is PCA dimension reduction? PCA reduces dimension but it is far more than that.

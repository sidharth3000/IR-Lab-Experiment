Matrix decomposition, also known as matrix factorization, involves describing a given matrix using its constituent elements. Perhaps the most known and widely used matrix decomposition method is the Singular-Value Decomposition, or SVD. All matrices have an SVD, which makes it more stable than other methods, such as the eigendecomposition. Obviously, we can use SVD to find PCA by truncating the less important basis vectors in the original SVD matrix.

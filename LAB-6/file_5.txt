The Singular-Value Decomposition, or SVD for short, is a matrix decomposition method for reducing a matrix to its constituent parts in order to make certain subsequent matrix calculations simpler. For the case of simplicity we will focus on the SVD for real-valued matrices and ignore the case for complex numbers. This becomes even harder for high-dimensional raw data. It is like finding a needle in a haystack. SVD allows us to extract and untangle information. In this article, we will detail SVD and PCA.
